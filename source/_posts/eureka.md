In a microservice architecture using Eureka for service discovery, services (clients) register themselves with the Eureka server. This allows them to discover each other and communicate.

## How It Works

- **Service Registration**: Each client service registers itself with the Eureka server at startup, providing metadata such as its hostname and port.

- **Service Discovery**: When a client needs to call another service, it queries the Eureka server for the available instances.

- **Load Balancing**: The client uses a load balancer like Ribbon to choose which instance to call.

- **Service Call**: The client uses a RestTemplate or a WebClient to make the HTTP call to the chosen service instance.

## Example Code

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@Service
public class ServiceAClient {

    @Autowired
    private RestTemplate restTemplate;

    public String callServiceB() {
        // 'service-b' is the application name of Service B registered with Eureka
        String serviceBUrl = "http://service-b/some-endpoint";
        return restTemplate.getForObject(serviceBUrl, String.class);
    }
}
```

In this example, `service-b` is the application name used by Service B to register with Eureka.

Remember to annotate your main application class with `@EnableDiscoveryClient` to enable discovery via Eureka.

## Conclusion

Using Eureka server and clients is an effective way to allow services within a microservice architecture to discover and communicate with each other, providing a dynamic and resilient system.
